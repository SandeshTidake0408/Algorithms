# The yfinance library uses the stock symbols from Yahoo Finance. You can search for any publicly traded companyâ€™s stock symbol on the Yahoo Finance website.

# For example, if you want to look up Amazon, you would use the symbol AMZN. For Google, which is under the parent company Alphabet, you would use GOOGL. For Apple, you would use AAPL.
